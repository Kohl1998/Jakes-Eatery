# Improved accessbility for an agency

## Description

For this application I helped an agency to improve the seo on their site to increase they rankings on search engines by adding values to their alt attributes for images/icons. Also, I helped them to improve accessibility for users who are visually impaired, as screen readers will help users with content on the page.

During the process I learnt how important semantic elements are for structuring websites, as it will help browsers to interpret the content of the page more efficiently. 

## Installation

As this was a feature request challenge I was provided with the starter code which provided me access to the html/css files.

Once I received this I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code.

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Usage
