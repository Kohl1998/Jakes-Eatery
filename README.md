# Website for small business

## Description

For this application I helped a restaurant build a website to help simplify user experience, by structuring the meals in columns down the page. 

My main objective for this was to help the business owner have a professional site to increase awareness around the business. Also, to boost conversion all round for the owners.

During the process I learnt more about css background properties in structuring content within grids.
